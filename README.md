A junior data scientist/software developer who takes pride in extracting data and building statistical and predictive models that translate data points to derive insight.
I also enjoy building software that improves the lives of those around me.
I am currently pursuing my bachelor in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence at Tilburg University.
